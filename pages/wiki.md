# This is my personal wiki.


It is inspired by wiki's, weblogs, and digital gardens like Devine Lu Linvega's [XIIVV](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html), Chase McCoy's [chasem.co](https://chasem.co/), Gwern Branwen's [gwern.net](https://gwern.net/) and so many [more](/site/links). 

If you would like to go deeper on digital gardens, check out Maggie Appleton's post on the [history and ethos of digital gardens.](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)


## How it started
 
 I gave myself the challenge of building a static site generator that would act as my personal wiki and portfolio. 

 I chose to use Go to build the site. Mostly, because I was studying it at the time, but also because I wanted to use a compiled and statically typed language. 

## The bones

This website is written in Go. It has two html templates, one for the site pages and one for the journal entries. The site pages and journal entries are written in Markdown and converted to HTML using Blackfriday a Markdown processor implemented in Go.

Find the code here [iamseeley/ts-wiki](https://github.com/iamseeley/ts-wiki).

## How it's going

I'm working on making a project template so other people can try it out!
