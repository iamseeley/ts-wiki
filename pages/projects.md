# Projects

## I'm curious about how things work.

I build for the web, make physical objects, and often take photos of travels.

<p> I enjoy dissecting what makes something exceptional. There's something very satisfying about watching all the intricate parts come together in a complex build. It's this passion for understanding and creation that drives every project I undertake.</p>
